# Exact CFG-Constrained Parallel Commitment for Diffusion Language Models

Research and implementation workspace for the TCC **Exact Maximum-Weight Parallel Commitment for CFG-Constrained Diffusion Language Models**.

The project implements an exact, certificate-producing optimizer for selecting the maximum-weight compatible set of token proposals at one denoising step. EPIC's serial and heuristic decoders remain read-only baselines. Results over pruned alternatives are reported as exact on the represented support, never as full-vocabulary or future-trajectory optimality.

## Sources of truth

Audit of batch-selection timing and practical-benefit claims:

- [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md): authoritative current milestone, completed evidence, and remaining work;

  the archived legacy plan and maintained English sources;

## Setup

The current reviewed delivery is the **2026-09-28 source snapshot**, described in
[`docs/releases/review-2026-09-28.md`](docs/releases/review-2026-09-28.md).
It combines a base Git bundle with the review patch, including M18/M19 and M20.
The local release v0.2.0 is historical and does not contain these later changes.
No new tag, commit or remote publication is implied. From the snapshot directory:

```bash
git clone ./mwpc-review-base.bundle tcc-final
cd tcc-final
git checkout --detach a43e1cf904eceff8bbcc802b5c0b2abb1c10c059
git apply ../mwpc-review.patch
git submodule update --init --recursive
make bootstrap
source .venv/bin/activate
make check
```

Scientific direction for the remaining month:
[certified JSON repair with protected fields](docs/research/2026-09-28-json-repair-plan.md).
This is a planned study; no repair results are claimed yet.

Artifact regeneration, clean CPU rehearsal, parser-binding, and optional CUDA
model instructions are in [`REPRODUCING.md`](REPRODUCING.md).

Build and verify the independent Rust production parser when the current task requires it:

```bash
make bootstrap-rust-parser
make test-rust-parser
make test-m6-differential
```

## Decoder strategy configuration

The reusable integration boundary validates `serial`, `epic`, and `exact`
commitment before model loading:

```bash
mwpc-commit-config --help
mwpc-commit-config \
  --commit-strategy exact \
  --exact-support-top-k 8 \
  --exact-eos-policy absent
```

Omitting `--commit-strategy` preserves EPIC's existing
`CONSTRAINED_DIFFUSION_REGULAR_COVER_BATCH` switch. Exact top-`K` decoding is
reported as `exact_on_support`; it is not a full-vocabulary or future-trajectory
optimality claim.

The first parent-side model hook is
`mwpc_exact.epic_adapter.llada.run_llada_exact_step`. It consumes the pinned
LLaDA loop's single-batch token, logit, prediction, and confidence rows after
the existing `k_s` schedule is known. It excludes prompt tokens from the CFG
canvas, restricts ordinary commits to the active block, applies only a live
independently validated optimum, and records canonical EOS/PAD suffix updates.
The vendor LLaDA implementation remains unchanged. A configured serial or EPIC
failure fallback must be supplied by its baseline adapter; selecting
`--exact-fallback none` requires no such callback.

Install the heavier pinned EPIC environment only for baseline or model-integration work:

```bash
make bootstrap-epic
```

Model weights, datasets, caches, credentials, and generated raw results are not committed.

## Agent handoff

```text
Read START_HERE.md, AGENTS.md, UPSTREAM.md, and TASKS.md. Locate the first
incomplete required task and continue in dependency order. Do not repeat
completed milestones or bypass correctness gates. Update a task's Evidence
field only after every acceptance criterion and required command passes.
Never invent measurements or replace article placeholders without versioned,
reproducible artifacts. Keep vendor/EPIC-Decoding read-only.
```
